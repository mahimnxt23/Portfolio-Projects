    'This package is unfortunately rather large (~20MB), and will run into scaling issues if more word lists '
    'or (especially) options are added. When that bridge is crossed, word lists should possibly be chosen by '
    'the user instead of simply including all of them; word lists could also be preprocessed on the client '

    'For writers, a random sentence can help them get their creative juices flowing. Since the topic of the '
    'sentence is completely unknown, it forces the writer to be creative when the sentence appears. There are a '
    'number of different ways a writer can use the random sentence for creativity. The most common way to use the '
    'sentence is to begin a story. Another option is to include it somewhere in the story. A much more difficult '
    'challenge is to use it to end a story. In any of these cases, it forces the writer to think creatively since '
    'they have no idea what sentence will appear from the tool.',

    'Python is a high-level, interpreted general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code '
    'readability with the use of significant indentation. Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It '
    'supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and '
    'functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive '
    'standard library.',

    'As always, we start with the imports. Because we make the UI with tkinter, we need to import it. We also '
    'import the font module from tkinter to change the fonts on our elements later. We continue by getting the '
    'partial function from functools, it is a genius function that excepts another function as a first argument '
    'and some args and kwargs and it will return a reference to this function with those arguments. This is '
    'especially useful when we want to insert one of our functions to a command argument of a button or a key '
    'binding.'
