In this project, we'll see a nice looking GUI made with TkInter to assist a user to check their typing speed against 
random paragraphs.

It'll show user letter based prompts which the user has to type in correctly matching the case also to spice it up a 
bit. After 1 minute passes, you'll see your WPM prompted on the screen. Feel free to leave comments or suggestions
regarding this project.
